# 3D-imaging-analysis-pipeline
An end-to-end Jupyter notebook for 3D time-lapse microscopy analysis: imports raw CZI files, applies anisotropy correction and noise removal, extracts object features, tracks particles with Trackpy and btrack, and offers interactive visualizations via Matplotlib, Plotly, ipywidgets, and Napari. Outputs are saved as pickle and Excel files.
